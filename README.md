# A Dockerized Flask dating app
### Using Flask, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap

As this was mostly an API oriented project, don't expect too much of the frontend, mostly here as an user-friendly way to test the beast.

### Requirements
- Docker
- docker-compose

## Database
The MariaDB SQL database will be created locally in the db folder

## Run
```bash
docker-compose up
```
