# A Dockerized Flask dating app
### Using Flask, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap

As this was mostly an API oriented project, don't expect too much of the frontend, mostly here as an user-friendly way to test the beast.

### Requirements
- Docker
- docker-compose

## First run
(Will be fixed later)
Uncomment the "db.create_all()" in app/__init__.py to properly initialize the database (which is not tracked by git)
Comment-it back after the first start, once you've seen the table creation in your terminal output

## Run
```bash
docker-compose up
```
